# Genji-Ball-additions
This is a repository with my additions to Genji Dodgeball.
I like making tweaks and such for the popular Overwatch game Genji Dodgeball. This is a repository with my additions. *Please note that I am not the creator of Genji Dodgeball. While you can feel free to take, alter, and distribute my code, other code may not be as open. Remember, you should always ask if you are unsure about using someone elses code.*
